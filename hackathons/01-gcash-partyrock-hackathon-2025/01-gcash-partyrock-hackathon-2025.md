# GCash PartyRock Hackathon 2025

## Experience

I saw the GCash hackathon invitation from a senior, Rodney. I immediately called my friends to discuss joining. We had been planning to join one, but it never pushed through. Jonel told us that if we kept ditching hackathons and making excuses, it would eventually be too late. So, we formed a group and invited two other friends from a different circle. We ended up with two groups:

- **Group 1:** Me, Luis, Jonel, and Topher
- **Group 2:** Emil, Octa, Dan, and Darren

After a week of waiting, my group received an acceptance email, but Emil's team didnâ€™t make it. It was sad, and it made us even more nervous because we needed Emilâ€™s guidance.

This was our **first-ever hackathon** as a college friend group. Our main goal was to gain hands-on experience on how hackathons work and what to expect in the future. Despite consulting other students about their hackathon experiences, we still felt unprepared. We strategized on how to **maximize our 1 hour and 30 minutes** effectively, but ultimately, the pressure got to us, and we couldnâ€™t fully stick to our plan.

### Arrival and First Impressions

Luis and I arrived early at the event. We saw teams from **PUP** and **TIP**â€”the TIP team was dressed in business attire and even had a professor with them. We were shaken when they all stared at us; it felt like they were seasoned competitors.

When the organizers arrived, they welcomed all participants and announced that there had been **200+ applications**. We couldnâ€™t believe we had made it that far! During breakfast, we had a chance to chat with the **Ateneo team**, which consisted of one CS student and two electronics engineering students. They jokingly mentioned that the CS student only invited non-CS members to reduce competition within their school, lol. They were friendly and approachable, making breakfast an enjoyable time. They even joked that if one of us won, we should give everyone a cut (ironically, they won 1st place).

### The Hackathon Begins

We were nervous and re-evaluating our idea. We expected that most teams would go for an **AI budgeting app**â€”and we were right! About **7 out of 12 teams** pursued that concept.

We brainstormed alternative ideas, such as:

1. **AI Business Simulation** â€“ A tool that provides business challenges for users.
2. **AI Business Tester** â€“ An app that evaluates whether a business idea is viable.

We went with the **business tester** concept. However, we already anticipated losing because the idea didnâ€™t seem profitable, and we couldnâ€™t fully justify its relevance to GCash. Still, with time pressure looming, we went for it anyway, lol.

### Presentations

As teams started presenting, one team stood outâ€”**Ateneo**. Their presenter delivered an **engaging, Shark Tank-style pitch**, packed with humor and energy. The Q&A was handled perfectly, and they had a solid response for every question. One great strategy we picked up from them was the response:

> "We'll consider that in our future innovations."

Then, it was our turn. I was the first to present, and I felt **confident** with the script I had prepared. Luis also delivered his part well. However, **the Q&A hit us hard**. The judges pointed out a flaw:

> "If you're targeting small to medium enterprises and aspiring entrepreneurs, why do you have a widget for business experience? If there was a business expert, why would they use this app?"

We had **no answer**. After a few seconds of silence, Jonel tapped me and saved us with a response, but the damage was done. After our presentation, I still felt nervousâ€”we were representing our university, after all. But at the end of the day, **we were here for the experience and learning**, not just the win.

Interestingly, a team known for excelling in **math and tech** (I wonâ€™t mention their school) team name was **"1st Place Winners"** didnâ€™t even place in the top 3. That gave us some relief (copium).

### Post-Hackathon Reflections

During lunch, we spoke with a member of the **UE Caloocan team**. They werenâ€™t expecting to win and were just looking forward to finishing the event so they could go home. I noticed his ID lace, which was from the **GDG Inolympics of PLM**â€”they had won **that** hackathon. That was an eye-opener for us; we had competed against champions!

### Awarding

- **ðŸ¥‡ 1st Place:** Ateneo
- **ðŸ¥ˆ 2nd Place:** TIP
- **ðŸ¥‰ 3rd Place:** DLSU

GCash gave us a **consolation prize** of **â‚±2,000 GCredit** and t-shirts. Even though we didnâ€™t place in the top 3, we still **achieved our main goal**â€”to experience and learn from the hackathon.

We skipped the post-event **caravan** (lowkey got lazy) and left the venue. **Now, weâ€™re hungry for more hackathons.**

## Lessons Learned

- **Be prepared.** Everyone is competing seriously and preparing extensively.
- **Ideate a profitable product.** Even if they say itâ€™s "for the wellness of the people blah blah blah" judges are still looking for profitability.
- **Don't leave holes in your product.** Know your **MVP** (Minimum Viable Product) inside and out.
- **Bring energy to your pitch.** Adding skits and jokes can **hook** the judges and make your presentation memorable.

Thatâ€™s it for our **first Hackathon**â€”on to the next one! ðŸš€
