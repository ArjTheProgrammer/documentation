## Human-Centered Design Foundations

### User Personas
- **Definition**: A representation of a group of people based on patterns among the population
- **Purpose**: Build solutions for real users, not just hypothetical ones
- **Hierarchy of preference**: Real user interviews > User personas > Nothing
- **When to use personas**: When finding real users is time-consuming or difficult
- **Best practice**: Use the prompt library to create detailed user personas

### Key Frameworks and Tools

#### Empathy Maps
- Technique to understand the user's mindset
- Framework to get into the mind of the user
- **Core question**: "Does this solve the problem that the user is facing?"

#### CRATE Model
- Used to write detailed, structured prompts
- **Process**: Test and iterate prompts until they work effectively
- **Tip**: Provide at least 3 example inputs for better AI generation

### Core Principle
> "Focus on having empathy for the user, getting into their minds, and building solutions for them"

## Research Hypothesis and Research Plan

### Methodology
- **Reference**: Use the prompt library for structured approach
- **Key principle**: Generate research hypotheses before ideating solutions
- **Rule**: Don't "boil the ocean" - avoid trying to research everything

### Research Hypothesis Generation
- **Traditional approach**: Generated by experienced professionals with domain expertise
- **Modern approach**: Use AI when you lack connections or network access
- **Process**: AI generation → Validation → Research execution

### Research Execution Strategy
1. **Scope**: Create a focused research plan
2. **Data collection**: Gather real user inputs
3. **Prioritization**: Select the most important hypotheses for your team
4. **Reality check**: You can't pursue all AI suggestions - choose actionable ones

### Key Insights
- Research hypotheses should be generated before deep research begins
- AI can supplement lack of experience or industry connections
- Always validate AI-generated hypotheses with real data

## Ideation for Solutions

### SCRAMPER Model
- **Framework**: Use SCRAMPER methodology for systematic ideation
- **Evaluation criteria**: Assess ideas based on:
  - **Innovation**: How novel is the solution?
  - **Feasibility**: Can it be realistically implemented?
  - **Scalability**: Can it grow and adapt?

### Team Prioritization
- **Focus**: Select the idea that makes the most sense for your team's capabilities
- **Resource consideration**: Align with available time, skills, and resources

### Critical Validation Questions
Before finalizing any solution, ask:
1. **"Do you understand your user?"**
   - Validate your user research and personas
   - Ensure deep empathy and understanding

2. **"Is this realistic?"**
   - Assess technical feasibility
   - Consider market constraints
   - Evaluate team capabilities

### Success Factors
- Ground solutions in solid user research
- Balance innovation with practical implementation
- Ensure team alignment on chosen direction
