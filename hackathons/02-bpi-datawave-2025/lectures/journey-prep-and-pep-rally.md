## Managing the Self

### Rituals

**Three things that support or derail our professional commitments:**

1. **Doing Things with Intention**
    - *Energy Givers*: What fills you up?
    - *Energy Drainers*: What drags you down?

2. **Doing Things Without Intention**
    - *Autopilot Indicators*: Signs you are functioning in robot or zombie mode
        - e.g., Forgetting to stand from your desk, accepting meeting invites without questioning why

3. **Doing Things Against Your Will**
    - Boundaries you currently have
    - Boundaries that often get crossed
    - Boundaries you struggle to draw

### Artifacts

- **Humanual**: A summary of how you work. Consider including:
    - Communication style
    - Working style
    - Work values
    - Ideal work environment
    - Ideal team values
    - Personal and professional boundaries
    - Feedback giving and receiving style
    - Kind of learner
    - Typical blockers

### Rest

- **Emotional Runway**: The space or path that leads up to emotional overload.
    - How much energy and bandwidth do we have left right now?
    - How much can we still give before our runway is depleted further?
    - Do we need to course correct or stage an intervention?
