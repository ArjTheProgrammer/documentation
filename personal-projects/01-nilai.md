## Overview

A journaling application that identifies emotions present in your journal entries and provides insights for better self-awareness.

Since March 2025 until this writing, my mind was consumed with negative thoughts from negative events and I was overwhelmed to the point that I didn't know what event caused what negative emotions and how long I was feeling those thoughts. I had to find a way to cope with these negative thoughts, so one of the approaches I took was reading self-help books that follow stoic teachings. Stoicism's main idea is letting go of the things you can't control and controlling only what you can, while loving your fate (Amor fati). They also encourage journaling, something that notable stoic philosophers like Marcus Aurelius and Seneca practiced — stoic philosophers practice journaling for self-reflection and awareness to be more mindful in their day-to-day lives.

This is for personal use only and I am still considering making it public in the future.

## Features

### Core Features (MVP)
- **Emotion Detection:** Automatically generates and identifies emotions present in each journal entry when saved. The emotion classification uses Google's [GoEmotions](https://research.google/blog/goemotions-a-dataset-for-fine-grained-emotion-classification/) dataset for fine-grained emotion recognition.
- **Personalized Insights:** Provides curated and relatable quotes based on your previous journal entries with explanations — inspired by The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday — and generates summaries of your past journal entries from the last 7 days.
- **Emotion Analytics:** Displays emotion taxonomy — positive, negative, ambiguous emotions — and tracks occurring emotions from the past 7 days with visual insights.
